# Freshbot

Freshbot now hosts the ParadeDB-backed runtime, registry tooling, and ingestion helpers that used to sit inside the Intellibot monolith. Use this repository for database-sourced agent/tool execution, registry loaders, and related planning docs; legacy file-config workflows stay in `intellibot/`.
