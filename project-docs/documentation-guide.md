# Documentation Guide

This guide tracks the major documentation assets across the Freshbot and Intellibot projects so you can quickly find reference material after the upcoming Codex CLI upgrade.

## Quick Table of Contents

| Freshbot | Project Ingestion | `project-docs/project-ingestion.md` | ParadeDB namespace snapshots, ingestion flow notes, and container-only run instructions.
| Freshbot | Codex MCP | `project-docs/codex-mcp.md` | Service summary, exposed tools, and editing workflow for the new FastMCP server.
| Freshbot | Documentation Guide | `project-docs/documentation-guide.md` | (This file) master index for docs.
| Intellibot | Project Overview | `intellibot/project-docs/project.md` | Legacy architecture outline, agent roles, and service inventory.
| Intellibot | FastMCP Playbook | `intellibot/project-docs/fastMCP.md` | How older FastMCP helpers were staged and exercised.
| Intellibot | Runtime Config | `intellibot/project-docs/runtime-config.md` | Environment variables, service URLs, and configuration expectations for the original stack.

## Notes

- Freshbot doc set is now the source of truth for the modular architecture and new MCP services.
- Intellibot docs remain valuable for legacy pipelines or when you need historical context; check this guide for quick summaries before diving into the longer files.
- When we upgrade the Codex CLI (see commands below), re-run `codex mcp list` to confirm the `freshbot_codex` server appears; the instructions for that service live in `project-docs/codex-mcp.md`.
